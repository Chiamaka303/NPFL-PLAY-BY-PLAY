# NFL Play-by-Play Analysis Dashboard
## Project Overview

This project provides an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of NFL play-by-play data, using Power BI to design an interactive dashboard. The dashboard highlights key performance metrics such as total plays, touchdowns, penalties, and average yards per play, while also breaking down insights by team, play type, and game dynamics.

The goal is to help analysts, coaches, and fans better understand performance trends, efficiency, and penalty impacts in NFL games.
